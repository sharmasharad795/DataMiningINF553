# DataMiningINF553
Projects and assignments done as part of INF 553 at USC

All the work has been carried out extensively by using Python and Spark.
Additionally, some streaming APIs such as Tweepy have been used at times.


HW1 - 

Task1: Basic data exploration using Spark

Task2: The two datasets together (i.e., review and business) are explored together and we
compute the average stars for each business category and output top n categories with the highest
average stars(1pts).

Task3: We compute the businesses that have more than n reviews in the review file (1pts). At the same time, we show the number of partitions
for the RDD and the number of items per partition with either default or customized partition function


HW2 -

We implement the SON algorithm using the Apache Spark Framework.
We also develop a program to find frequent itemsets in two datasets, one simulated dataset
and one real-world dataset generated from Yelp dataset.
